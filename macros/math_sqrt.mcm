Description: A simple macro to easily get the square root of a number
###
# scaled by 1000
# you can change the scale, but it can only be a multiple of 10 that has even zeroes
# actual scale will be number divided by 1000
# USAGE: sqrt <name> <objective> (<name> <objective>) 
# (<name> <objective>) means the output could be redirected to another score
